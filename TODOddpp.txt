~~~ BUGS ~~~

## commands ##
Almost all chat commands added require a character to be executed or it returns.
But for example /shop doesnt need it change it but be carefull it can cause crashbugs

## instagib killingspree (sv_intsa 1) ##
if you get killed by a player who left the game things get crazy even in vanilla
so stick to the blockkillingspreesystem and all is fine c:

and also if players are missing for killingsprees make it possible to end killingsprees but end how? better think of it good and maybe look ad the blockklinningspree system

## IsSameIP ##
behaves weird on local server with dummys check if it works online
and also behaved weird on official server (not local). i did '/gift Chillingo.*' and server said "don't gift ur dummy" 

~~~ ADD ~~~

## flag drops ##
the eye pos has influence on flag drop direction 

## spread gun ##
add spreading guns for supermoderators and admins to showoff only WEAPON_GUN
and maybe speedup the shootingspeed and fullauto and stuff all other weapons would be cheaty

## blockspree reward ##
every spree message (5,10.. kills ) give +50 money and +50 xp

## AddSurvival ##
add the famous survival mod into ddpp
hide names in player.cpp ::Snap()

## king of hill ##
Capturing areas with bloody tiles which show the current leading tee

## block points dummy check ##
im very insecure baut diz. But maybe add a check where only non equal ips can collect block points

## waveblock bot sub mod ##
add something like monster where you have to hold a position
and if all humans are freezed round restarts
and add upgrades only for this sub mod like
weapons (with ammo)
jetpack
endless

## quest todo ##
inform a player of all the progress in chat if actiavted (/show /hide)

## Apocalypse ##
rework map and copy paste the whole map and then edit it to a broken version
more doodads and some gernric tiles missing and stuff like this.
then code something which changes spawns to this spawns
and init it with something crazy (for example combine all stuff 166 420 and maybe send some sounds and or a broadcast saying "rip world")
then kill all player.. and *plopp* they are in a Apocalypse version of the server o.O
the killall() maybe needs a KillDDPP() in the character.cpp DDPP_DIE() func to kill all the ddpp stuff running (minigames and stuff)

## ip und clan speichern ##
mehr daten über den user sammeln und last names mal gut testen und wenn nötig fixxen
Name Fix [ ]
IP [x]
Clan [ ]
Skin [ ]
Country [ ]
last login date [ ]

## SQL COMMAND ##
ALTER TABLE Accounts
ADD <name> VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT '';
add this commadn '/sql_add <name> <char16 char32 char64 char128 int> <default>'
so tables can be updated ingame
or add it as a rcon so it can be executed via file executer code

## Homing Missiles ##
Die Waffe selber kann ab police lvl 4 erworben werden.
Monition kann jedoch jeder an den munition spawner tiles sammeln (die dort random spawnen)

## jail ##
add reasons why people get arrested (bankrob, spawnblock, report)
and add a report command
"/report (player) (reason)" to report a player
und dann ein paar reasons:
- spawnblocking
- hacking
- insulting
- scamming
und wenn dann genung reports der selben reason ankamen wird die police auf den geschickt

## police ##
add a list of gangsters their gangsta reason and escape time

## warps ##
add warps like in minecraft
/tele_create (name)
/tele (name)
works ingame
supermoderators can create some for much money but only if x < cfgrated (to avoid race cheats)
and all tele there for some money

COULD AND TO DOS:

//gamecontext.cpp code: cfv45
COULD inform creator live if some1 watched if he has this feed activated (use new show command)
